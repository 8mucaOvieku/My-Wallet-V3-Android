## What is Hackboot 1?
 
Hackboot 1 is a program that modifies the ACPI table of your UEFI system to replace the default Windows boot logo with a custom one. It works by injecting a new BGRT (Boot Graphics Resource Table) entry into the ACPI table that points to a BMP file stored on your EFI partition. The BMP file can be any image you want, as long as it has the same resolution and aspect ratio as your screen.
 
Hackboot 1 is compatible with Windows 10, 8.1, and 8, and supports both 64-bit and 32-bit UEFI systems. It also allows you to change the resolution of your boot screen and switch between different images randomly. Hackboot 1 is free and open source, and you can find the source code and releases on GitHub[^2^].
 
## How to Download Hackboot 1?
 
To download Hackboot 1, you need to visit the GitHub page of the project[^2^] and click on the latest release. You will see a ZIP file named HackBGRT-<version>.zip, where <version> is the version number of the release. Download this ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your computer.</version></version>
 
The ZIP file contains three files: setup.exe, config.txt, and HackBGRT.efi. Setup.exe is the installer that will copy HackBGRT.efi to your EFI partition and modify your boot entry. Config.txt is the configuration file that lets you customize various settings of Hackboot 1, such as the image path, resolution, random mode, etc. HackBGRT.efi is the main executable that will run at boot time and change your boot logo.
 
## How to Use Hackboot 1?
 
Before you use Hackboot 1, you need to disable Secure Boot on your UEFI system. Secure Boot is a feature that prevents unauthorized programs from running at boot time, and it will prevent Hackboot 1 from working. To disable Secure Boot, you need to reboot your computer and enter the UEFI setup menu. The exact steps may vary depending on your computer model and manufacturer, but usually you need to press a key like F2, F10, or Del during the initial boot screen. Once you are in the UEFI setup menu, look for an option called Secure Boot or Boot Security and disable it.
 
After disabling Secure Boot, you can run setup.exe from the folder where you extracted Hackboot 1. The installer will ask you to confirm that you want to install Hackboot 1 and warn you about the possible risks of modifying your boot entry. If you agree, it will copy HackBGRT.efi to your EFI partition and create a new boot entry called "HackBGRT" that will run before Windows. It will also backup your original boot entry in case you want to restore it later.
 
Next, you need to edit config.txt to specify the image file that you want to use as your boot logo. You can use any BMP file that has the same resolution and aspect ratio as your screen. You can also change other settings in config.txt, such as the resolution of your boot screen, the random mode that will switch between different images every time you boot up, etc. For more details on how to edit config.txt, please refer to the README file on GitHub[^2^].
 
Finally, you need to reboot your computer and enjoy your new boot logo. If everything goes well, you should see your custom image instead of the Windows logo when you turn on your computer. If something goes wrong or if you want to revert back to the original boot logo, you can run setup.exe again and choose the option to uninstall Hackboot 1.
